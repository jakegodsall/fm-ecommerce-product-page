# E-Commerce Product Page (Frontend Mentor)

This is a solution to the [E-commerce product page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ecommerce-product-page-UPsZ9MJp6). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

&#9745; View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

&#9745; See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

&#9745; Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image

&#9745; Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images

&#9745; Add items to the cart

&#9745; View the cart and remove items from it

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS library

### What I learned

This was a great project to get more realistic practice using React and TailwindCSS. I decided not to try using any new frameworks or tools in this project, but rather to just really foucs on training the fundamentals.

Most significantly, in this project I have worked with:

- Portals for modals and correct order or rendering in the DOM (cart modal, navigation bar modal, image viewer lightbox modal).
- Passing state up and down the React tree (with attention to following the principle of least privilege).

### Continued development

Although I believe the UI for this project looks professional, I am aware that the methods I have used to acheive this are not completely scalable. For example, it would not be simple to add another product to the site without having to completely rewrite several components.

This is something I consider working on in the future, as well as perhaps building a very simple REST API with five or so distinct products.
